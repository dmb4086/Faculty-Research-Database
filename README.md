# Faculty-Research-Database
Department faculty regularly engage in research and publish their results. 
They are often looking to work with other faculty and students, 
but it is difficult to keep track of what each person is working on 
and interests to find collaborators. This is my effort to solve that problem on a small 
scale by writing a database application that will allow users to view and search other users by certain filters/keywords

## NOTE

This file is hosted on RIT's serenity server and is closed to RIT. This is becuase RIT allows students to host a database with unlimited storage 
for free and the database. 

## Description for nerds
The databse is a MySQL database and we used PHP to communicate and update the database. The PHP establishes a 
connection with the database and is resonsible for adding records and populating the tables. 

This is handy tool for people looking for a mentor for their capstone project at RIT
